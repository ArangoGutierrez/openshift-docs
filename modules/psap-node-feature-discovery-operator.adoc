== Purpose
endif::operators[]
The Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) manages the detection of hardware features and configuration in an OpenShift cluster by labeling the nodes with hardware-specific information. NFD will label the host with node-specific attributes, like PCI cards, kernel, or OS version, and many more. See (Upstream NFD) for more info.

The NFD operator can be found on the Operator Hub by searching for “Node Feature Discovery”
